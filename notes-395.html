<h2>Version 2.0b6 (5 bugs fixed; 3 new features)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Improved user experience. Now it is much faster to open, to reload shows, to add a show, etc. I mean MUCH faster. And it does not hangs (never say never).</li>
<li>Added new preference to download by default any new show in HD or SD (it was previously implemented, but it was discontinued for the sake of clarity; clarity is not here anymore so it is back).</li>
<li>Added subtle HD mark in the show covers to differentiate which shows are been downloaded in HD an which not.</li>
<li>Added more localizations. Only in Spanish, but now those things can be localized in other languages too in the near future.</li>
<li>The actual downloading of torrents is halted because EZRSS is down.</li>
</ul>
